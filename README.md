# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is about creating an etch-a-sketch with html, javascript and css. The user should start with a 16x16 grid but be able to adjust it to what they want up to a max of about 100 to keep from creating a resource heavy app. They should be able to click a button to erase the grid. If I can figure it out I can also add in a rainbow color option so they can paint with random colors vs only using black.
